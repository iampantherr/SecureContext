## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-17 — RBAC Default-On & Channel-Key Enforcement (**BREAKING**)

### Breaking changes
- **`RBAC_ENFORCE` now defaults to `true`.** Every `zc_broadcast` requires a valid HMAC-signed `session_token` bound to an `agent_id` + `role`. The pre-v0.9.0 "no active sessions → no RBAC" advisory path is removed.
- **`CHANNEL_KEY_REQUIRED` now defaults to `true`.** An unregistered project rejects all broadcasts until the operator calls `zc_broadcast(type='set_key', channel_key=...)`. The pre-v0.9.0 "open mode" is removed.

### Added
- **Agent-ID binding at the reference monitor.** The broadcast's `agent_id` must equal the token's bound `aid` claim — closes the Chapter 11 capability-confinement gap where a worker with a valid STATUS-capable token could post a broadcast carrying `agent_id='orchestrator'` and have the dispatcher route it as one.
- **12 red-team tests (T_R01–T_R12)** covering positive controls, `AGENT_ID_MISMATCH`, missing/expired/revoked/tampered tokens, cross-project token rejection (`ph` claim mismatch), role privilege escalation (worker → ASSIGN / REJECT / REVISE), `ZC_RBAC_ENFORCE=0` opt-out verified via child process, and `CHANNEL_KEY_REQUIRED` rejection on a bare project.
- **`zc_status`** now reports `RBAC enforcement: ACTIVE (v0.9.0 default)` and `Channel key: REQUIRED (v0.9.0 default)` (or the matching `DISABLED`/`optional` lines when env opt-outs are set).

### Changed
- **`verifyChannelKey()`** now throws when no key is registered and `CHANNEL_KEY_REQUIRED=true`, instead of returning `true` in silent open mode.
- **`broadcastFact()`** RBAC block is now unconditional (behind `Config.RBAC_ENFORCE`). The previous `hasActiveSessions(db)` shortcut — which would quietly disable RBAC on a fresh DB — is removed.
- **Legacy Category 7 broadcast tests (T_B01–T_B07)** retooled to bootstrap a channel key + issue a session token, matching v0.9.0 default-on auth. T_B02 re-focused from "open-mode spoofing documented" (impossible now) to "legitimate developer MERGE accepted" as a positive control complementing T_R09.

### Migration
- **Recommended path:** call `zc_broadcast(type='set_key', channel_key=...)` once per project, then call `zc_issue_token(agent_id, role)` at session start and pass `session_token=` + `channel_key=` on every `zc_broadcast`. The A2A dispatcher `start-agents.ps1` wiring automates this — see the dispatcher repo for the script changes.
- **Legacy path (trusted single-user desktop):** set `ZC_RBAC_ENFORCE=0` + `ZC_CHANNEL_KEY_REQUIRED=0` in your MCP server's `env` block. Not recommended on any setup where the MCP server is network-reachable.

### Security
- **449 unit tests pass** across 20 test files.
- **96 red-team attack vectors: 91 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 WARN** (all five warnings are pre-existing documented limitations from v0.8.0 or earlier — sandbox filesystem isolation, detached subprocess containment, javascript: URI explicit-guard hardening, Unicode lookalike header, concurrent sandbox env isolation).

- `Store` interface with SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL + pgvector backends.
- HTTP API server (`src/api-server.ts`) with Bearer auth, rate limiting, full RBAC surface.
- Docker stack (`docker/`) with named `securecontext-*` containers, GPU overlays, and `start.ps1`/`start.sh`.
- Smart working memory sizing (dynamic 50–200 facts by project complexity).
- Auto memory extraction in PostToolUse hook.
- 192 integration tests, all passing.
